This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Deploy
Simply push to `master` and Heroku will pick up the code to build and deploy automatically.

- Heroku Dashboard: https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/ninjaman-web
- App will be deployed to: https://ninjaman-web.herokuapp.com/

## Local development

Here I use `yarn` but you can also use `npm`.

Install dependencies with `yarn install`. Then run the app with `yarn start`.

If for some reasons, you want to build the production version, run `yarn build`.
